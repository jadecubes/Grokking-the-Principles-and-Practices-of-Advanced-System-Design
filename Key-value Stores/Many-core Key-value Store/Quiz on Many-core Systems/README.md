# Quiz on Many-core Systems


**Question 1**
In the context of the key-value system, why was the domain-specific system better than the general-purpose x86 node?

**Answer**
There are multiple reasons why weâ€™ve preferred a domain-specific system over the general-purpose system:

- Good performance per watt
- Better opportunity for parallelization due to the availability of many cores


**Question 2**
What are some of the cons of using a domain-specific system?

**Answer**
Oftentimes, a domain-specific system has many peculiarities that are not found in a general-purpose system. Some of these can be as follows:

Small virtual address space and larger physical addressability.
Needing to change the software to benefit from the system fully.
Absolute processor performance is lower than a typical general-purpose system, hindering some use cases.




**Question 3**
Our designed key-value store helped in storing much more keys in one node. Is that not a bad idea when a node fails since it will take down a large portion of the keys?

**Answer**
It is a trade-off between key density in a node versus fault tolerance. If we pack more keys in a node and it fails, it reduces the availability of all those keys. If we keep a few keys in a node, we will not be utilizing expensive resources efficiently.

Usually, key-value stores are used as in-memory caches for data. On failure, we will need to refill this cache on a new node.

We encourage you to think about how you will balance this trade-off between key density and fault tolerance.
