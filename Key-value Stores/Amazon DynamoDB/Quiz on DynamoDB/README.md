** Question 1 *8
How does our design take advantage of the multi-tenant architecture?

Answer
The multi-tenant architecture allows us to use our resources efficiently. Dedicating one node for one table could result in underutilization if the table contains a limited amount of data. To scale the table, we might need to dedicate another node if the first node cannot store all the tableâ€™s data. One node dedicated to the table is utilized well, while the other could be underutilized. The multi-tenant architecture allows us to spread our tables across our network as partitions, thus spreading the potential effect of underutilizing dedicated resources.

Multi-tenant architecture also enables easy scaling since we can allocate and deallocate resources at the partition level.
